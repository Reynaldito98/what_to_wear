# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

# Project Description
In this project we work on the backend of the project of name "What to Wear". We create a server and tell them what to do according to the requests that the user sends through controllers and routers. We create two models. One for the clothing Items and the user info.

We use MongoDB, Express, Node JS as tools to create this server.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
